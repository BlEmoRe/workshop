The BLEMORE workshop and competition on multimodal blended emotion recognition will be held at the 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII 2025) in Canberra, Australia.
BLEMORE aims to inspire further development on the still under-represented topic of blended emotion recognition. By combining a competition with a workshop format, our hope is that BLEMORE will lead to concrete and measurable technical advances, while also providing a forum for reflection and exchange between researchers working in the field.
The workshop will take place on the 11th of October 2025.

# News

## Test Dataset Released (2025-06-15)

Weâ€™ve now published the test partition of the BlEmoRe dataset on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15668840).
The new Zenodo version includes a set of test videos and a [submission_template.json](/submission_template.json) file.

Participants are invited to submit their predictions in the template format to: Petri Laukka: petri.laukka@psyk.uu.se

We will evaluate them on our server. The evaluation will be based on the two metrics defined in the challenge: `ACC_presence` and `ACC_salience`.

## New Baselines Released (2025-06-09)

New baselines for the BLEMORE Challenge are now available.

The baselines include models using features extracted from pre-trained video and image encoders:
- **CLIP**
- **ImageBind**
- **VideoMAEv2**
- **Video Swin Transformer**

Features are either aggregated into video-level representations or subsampled from short clips. Lightweight feedforward models (Linear, MLP) are trained to predict emotion presence and salience following the challenge evaluation protocol.

Code and instructions are available in the updated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BlEmoRe/blemore-common).


## Paper Submission (2025-06-09)
Submissions to the BLEMORE Workshop are now open!  
Please use the following link to submit your paper:

[Submit via EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=blemoreworkshopacii2)

**1. General Track:** We invite submissions concerned with the general problem of blended emotion recognition.

**2. Challenge Track:** In this track, we invite submissions which utilize the challenge dataset and pre-defined evaluation metrics.
