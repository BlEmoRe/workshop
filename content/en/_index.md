The BLEMORE workshop and competition on multimodal blended emotion recognition will be held at the 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII 2025) in Canberra, Australia.
BLEMORE aims to inspire further development on the still under-represented topic of blended emotion recognition. By combining a competition with a workshop format, our hope is that BLEMORE will lead to concrete and measurable technical advances, while also providing a forum for reflection and exchange between researchers working in the field.
The workshop will take place on the 11th of October 2025.
