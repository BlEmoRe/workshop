## BLEMORE Workshop and Competition on Multimodal Blended Emotion Recognition at ACII’25

Humans often experience multiple emotions simultaneously, known as blended emotions, such as feeling both sadness and anger when facing an unjust loss or happiness and surprise at a birthday party. However, emotion recognition research has largely focused on single emotions due to limited datasets and a lack of awareness. BLEMORE aims to bridge this gap by advancing the recognition of multimodal blended emotional expressions.
We invite submissions on blended emotion recognition in two tracks: a challenge track and a reflection track.
The challenge track introduces a novel dataset of multimodal emotion expressions that contains both single emotions and blended emotions conveyed with similar and varying proportions. This dataset is used in the challenge, which addresses the task of recognizing the relative salience of emotions in a given blend. Papers addressing the BLEMORE challenge should follow a pre-defined evaluation protocol. Submission for the reflection track should be relevant for the general topic of blended emotion recognition and may employ other datasets or problem formulations.
 
1.     Challenge Track: In this track, we invite submissions which utilize the challenge dataset and pre-defined evaluation metrics. For this challenge, we employ two main evaluation metrics:
    -  *ACCpresence* measures whether the correct label(s) are predicted without errors. A correct prediction must include all present emotions while avoiding false negatives (e.g., predicting only one emotion in a blend) and false positives (e.g., predicting emotions that are not part of the label).
    -  *ACCsalience* extends *ACCpresence* by considering the relative prominence of each emotion. It evaluates whether the predicted proportions reflect the correct ranking—whether the emotions are equally present or one is more dominant than the other. This metric applies only to blended emotions.

2.     Reflection Track: Here, we invite submissions concerned with the general problem of blended emotion recognition. In contrast to the challenge track, the focus of papers is not to improve performance on the evaluation dataset, but to generate new insights into the problem. Evaluation on the challenge dataset is not required but will still be valued.
In addition, we encourage submissions in both tracks to provide information about how various blended emotions are expressed, e.g. by providing lists of predictor importance, to increase the explainability of their systems.

### Important Dates
    - Paper submission deadline for workshops: 30 June 2025
    - Workshop papers decision notification: 28 July 2025
    - Workshop camera-ready deadline: 20 August 2025
 
### Submission
Papers can be submitted via ACII’s [submission portal](https://easychair.org/account2/signin?l=9161489160958518132) In the portal, you will have the option to specifically submit to the workshop.
Submissions in both tracks should following the general ACII guidelines (max. 7 pages main text + 1 page optional ethics statement + unlimited references).

**Please note that all submitted papers should be anonymized for the review process.**
